# GDG? Never heard of it - Stefan Hoth

[Google Developer Groups (GDGs)](https://developers.google.com/groups/) are communities of developers who are interested in Google's developer technology; everything from products like Android, Chrome, Drive, and Google Cloud platforms, over APIs like the Cast API, Maps API, and YouTube API, to programming languages like Go or Dart - there's a topic for everyone! With over 600 chapters worldwide - and counting - there's one close to you for sure!

In this short talk you'll get a quick overview why YOU should get involved with your local GDG.
