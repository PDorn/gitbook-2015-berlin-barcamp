* Session could have bene better scheduled as some were only 15 Miminutes short and one could have attended more talks.
* Sessions speaker should have better prepared their session - Friedger disagreed as this is what can/should/might happen at barcamps. It is the audience that drives the content
* All speakers should please add some content to j.mp/droidcon.de. Why did it not work with the buddies
* Have a lightning slot were people can present 5 minutes some cool stuff.
