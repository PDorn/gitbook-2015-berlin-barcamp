# How to Improve Efficiency
##(without dying while trying)
by Sergio Tomas (Badoo)


Common problem, you are working on something and the requirements change, forcing you to throw away all your nice code.

## Defining the Problem

When doing a big project, you need to know where to starts. Here your preparations are important.

The bigger the project, the bigger the risk of requirements changes are.

The big issue here are changes in requirements. Things will change every day, until the project is done.

This leads to wasted effort/work. 

## How to fight inefficiency

* Define the big picture (Planning, don't just go straight to coding)
* Creating a skelton (Since you;ve akreay planned out what you need you can now create a skeleton for the whole project)
* Defining your views (Rough definition of the designs/layouts but don't do pixel perfect yet! Otherwise you will waste time when you have to change things later)
* Divide & conquer (Tiger or a lot of kittens! Break down into many simple tasks. Get something qorking as soon as possible so you can get feedback and iterate)
* Abstract your problems (Keep iterating from the most abstract level down to the fine details (last), start with mocking).
* Final polishing (This takes a lot of time so you only want to do it once! 20% of the work, taking 80% of the time).

### Extra tips

* (Pixel perfect is expensive), only do it once, last thing you do
* YAGNI (You are not going to need it), don't implement the stuff you need!
* Blockages, face blockages as soon as possible. These are not productive, just a waste of yir time, fix asap! Try to never be blocked for more than an hour!
* Raise issues as soon as possible. If you think what your are implementing does not make sense then let people know as soon as possible!
* Don't improve unfinished things (e.g don't spend time polishing before the feature is done)
