# Android Template Project - Eugen Martynov (@emartynov)

## Why?

The idea to have project that is ready to clone and prototype. It is buildable, testable and understandable.
More beyond it is on going documentation where we share stable dependencies, common components (Licences activity), latest findings for automation, etc.

## Overview

The project start should be matter of seconds or minutes - check out, import to studio, run gradle. The first run require internet 
connection and time to download and install dependencies.
The central point is gradle files. Everything that you're doing should be automated and possile via gradle tasks.
The minimal setup contains three modules - java library, android library, android application. If you don't need any of them just delete it.
